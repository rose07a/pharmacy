   		<h2 class="justleft"> Pain Management is a Journey Not A Destination</h2>
<p class="justleft"><strong>Welcome to Pain GPS Clinic.</strong> My name is Vanessa Johnston. I am a board certified family nurse practitioner, specialized in Pain Management. People often ask why I chose Pain Management and the answer is personal.
<br><br>
My husband and I met when we were in the military, we had lived through many life-changing events. But nothing could prepare us for October 29th 2017. At 8:39am a driver fell asleep at the wheel and at 60 mph crossed into oncoming traffic and collided into my husbands car.
<br><br>
We are forever grateful to the entire care team who saved his life. While hospitalized he was placed on continuous intravenous opioids and transitioned to oral opioids. After discharge from the hospital we thought we were through the worst of it and life would go back to normal.
<br><br>
He was discharged from the hospital with a script for oral opioids and instructions to follow up with the orthopedic and primary care providers. He received a second 30-day script for opioids and was told it would be the last one without further explanation or mention of pain management services. What followed is what brought us into the world of acute severe opioid withdrawal, chronic pain syndrome, depression, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, panic attacks, post traumatic stress, and thoughts of self harm. As a family with two young children we found ourselves in despair.
<br><br>
This is only one story in a sea of stories with similar echoes of suffering and the effects of chronic pain that ripple beyond the patient through families and communities. Management of pain is a vital component of health and well-being. It is my mission to provide compassionate pain management services in Lane County and empower others (patients, families, and providers) through education.

    	   <p class="left">DDr. Morris is a graduate of U.C. Davis School of Medicine and completed his Family Medicine residency at Oregon Health & Science University in 1982 and remains board certified. In 1990, he joined Oregon Pain Center as a fellow in Pain Management. Two years later, Dr. Morris resumed private practice focusing on Medical Pain Management. He is the co-founder and past president of the Pain Society of Oregon. In 2005, he established a multidisciplinary pain management team, comprised of independent medical practitioners at the Willamette Medical Center. In 2018 Dr. Morris sold his practice and continued as the Medical Director of Pain Management Partners until its doors closed April 30, 2020. He continues to work at Lane County Family Medicine in primary care.</p>

    	  <p class="left">Vanessa is a Family Nurse Practitioner, board certified by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners since 2018 and licensed to practice in the state of Oregon. She received her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Texas Tech University Health Science Center.
<br>
Vanessa has worked in healthcare for over 20 years. Her learning began as an active duty Pharmacy Journeyman for the United States Air Force in one of countries largest outpatient pharmacies serving a tri-state area and one of the first to introduce robotics. After being honorably discharged as a decorated soldier, she completed her Bachelors of Science in Nursing in 2009. She has worked as a registered nurse in Pediatrics, Womenâ€™s Health, Geriatrics, and Intensive Care.
<br>
In 2014, she moved to Eugene to raise her children in a place more in alignment with her morals and values. In 2017, as the Chief Nursing Officer at White Bird Clinic she helped secure a critical HRSA grant worth 1.5 million dollars. In 2018 she became a Nurse Practitioner and shortly after began her apprenticeship with Dr. Morris at Pain Management Partners to learn the specialty and art of Pain Management. She practiced there until its doors closed May 15, 2020.
